In the files of here are 3 implementations for finding the highest ascii value in a given line of the provided wikidump on Beocat. The three implementations are avaliable in three separate folders all labeled as 3way-implementation name. When you extract the file, to run a job for a given implementation note that each folder has its own 
make and submission script these allow for jobs to be ran. Before a job can be ran you must first build the file you can do so by simply entering "make" into the command line and hitting enter this will build the files, the way each implementation is set up allows for different variables to be controlled for a given job to run a different variable job you can do the following
1. make clean 2. make FIELDS="-DAMOUNT_LINES=2000 -DLINE_LENGTH=4000" these will change the amount of lines and length of lines that the job will execute with you can change it to any number that seems sensical. To change a job's variables simply use nano submit_job1.sh to enter the command line editor for the code, you can change the variables at the top which are
commented to let you know what to do. To run a job ensure that the build files are present by running make and then use this command sbatch submit_job1.sh this will submit the job to Beocat and provide you with the job number. To check the progress of the job or the job's statistics during run time use the command seff followed by the job number provided by Beocat.
